# plant_disease_prediction

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting diseases in plants using images. The model is trained on a dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves to classify and identify various plant diseases effectively.


## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images of plant leaves, categorized into different classes (healthy and various diseases). You can download the dataset from:
